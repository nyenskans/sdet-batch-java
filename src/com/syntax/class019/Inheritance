                        INHERITANCE IN JAVA


Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming).
It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit (acquires) all the features
(properties/fields and behaviour/methods) of another class.


* Parent cannot access the child, only vice versa
* We can only inherit from one parent in java
* Multiple classes can inherit from the same class (multiple child classes from one parent class)
* Whatever changes we make to the parent class, child classes will reflect them as well


Why we should use it:
Helps us reduce amount of code (properties and methods which are present in many classes --> we can create only one parent class
to contain those common properties and methods and make children classes to extend from them)
How to use it:
1. Create a parent class
2. Put all the common methods and properties from children classes inside that parent class
3. use extends keyword to inherit from that parent class



RULES:
1. Private fields and methods cannot be inherited inside children classes
2. Constructors are not inherited --> but we can call it from the child class
3.

Types of inheritance
1. Single inheritance
2. Multilevel inheritance
3. Hierarchical inheritance
