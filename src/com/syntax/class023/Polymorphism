                        Polymorphism





Method Overloading is a Compile time polymorphism. // rarely used to achieve polymorphism
We can tell you which method will be called before running the code
In method overloading, more than one method shares the same method name with a different signature in the class.
In method overloading, the return type can or can not be the same, but we have to change the parameter because,
in java, we can not achieve the method overloading by changing only the return type of the method.

Method Overriding is a Run time polymorphism.
We don't know which method will be called before running the code
In method overriding, the derived class provides the specific implementation of the method that is already provided
by the base class or parent class. In method overriding, the return type must be the same or co-variant
 (return type may vary in the same direction as the derived class).
