                            Encapsulation


Encapsulation is a mechanism that provides us security. Fourth pillar of OOP
Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
It is achieved in java by class concept

Combining of state and behavior in a single container is known as encapsulation

In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes,
and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
It is also known as data hiding

How we should use it:
    1. make your variables private
    2. create setter and getter methods to read and write these fields
