                            Type casting in Java


 Assigning value of one type to a variable of another type is called Type casting.

 There are two types of casting in java:
        1. Widening / UpCasting (implicit / automatic) casting- Converting lower data type into higher
        (for primitive data types the example for UpCasting is converting byte to int -->
        --> int a = 1;)
        2. Narrowing / DownCasting (explicit / manual) casting- Converting higher data type into lower
        (for primitive data types example for DownCasting is converting double to int -->
        --> int a = (int) 10.99;)

 Type Casting in non-primitive data types in Java:
              Object                   upcasting/widening

               Animal
         (silently extends Object)

              Mammal
          (extends Animal)

         Dog          Cat
  (extends Animal) (extends Animal)     downcasting/narrowing


  Upcasting: Casting from a subclass to a superclass is called upcasting.
  Downcasting: Casting from a superclass to a subclass.


  Parent       Parent p = new Child()        // upcasting
     |
     |
    extends     Child c = new Parent()        // trying to downcast
     |           (compile time error)
     |
   Child        Parent p = new Child();
                Child c = (Child)p;           // downcasting
                 (allowed because p prefers child in this case)
