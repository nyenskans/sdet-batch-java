1. Variables inside of classes but outside any block of code are called instance variables

2. Variables inside blocks of code (loop, switch, if else condition) or inside methods are called local variables
Also if they are a part of method's parameters, they are local

3. Static variables (with keyword static in front of data type--> static String name="Katarina")
Static variable in Java is a variable which belongs to the class and is initialized only once at the start of the execution.
 It is a variable which belongs to the class and not to object(instance ).
Static variables are initialized only once, at the start of the execution.


Using the proper types of variables helps with:

1. reducing the amount of RAM the application uses
2. with the help of these vars we can pass information between methods of class
3. local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time-
-as soon as the method is done they are destroyed by a special program (garbage collector)



How to use:

Instance: create inside of class but outside any block of code or method
Local: create inside block of code
Static- just adding keyword static
We can call them without creating an object of a class
We can share a single value between all the objects of a class
  //  static variables are available to all the objects of the same class
