                Access Modifiers in java

Keywords in java that help us control the access of classes, variables, methods and other blocks of code.
Four access levels (but only three keywords):
1. private
2. default (not a keyword, automatically applied)
3. protected
4. public

1. Private:
    Only accessible within that class
    It is the most restricted access modifier
2. Default
    When we don't use an access modifier keyword with a field/method, default is applied by java
    We can access the variable/method/etc within the same class and in all other classes which exist inside the same package
    Second most restrictive access modifier
3. Protected
    We can access methods/variables/etc inside the same (class and) package and inside classes in different packages which must have 'Extends' relationship
    with the original class (New_class_name Extends Original_Class_Name)
4. Public
    We can use methods/variables/etc anywhere inside same project
