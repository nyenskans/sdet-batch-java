                        Method Overloading


Naming methods and classes is very important in development and they should always be meaningful.

Existence of multiple methods in the same class can have the same name with different parameters (different types of parameters/
different number of parameters/ different sequence of parameters) is known as method overloading.

Instead of defining two methods that should do the same thing, it is better to overload one.

 Multiple methods can have the same name as long as the number and/or type of parameters are different.

Java does not allow overloading by changing the return type only, though overloaded methods can have different return types.

There are three ways to overload the method in
java:
1. By changing number of parameters
2. By changing the data type
3. By changing the sequence/order of parameters

Advantages:
1. Code cleanliness
2. Increases the readability of the program
3. Flexibility
4.Overloaded methods give programmers the flexibility
  to call a similar method for different types of data
