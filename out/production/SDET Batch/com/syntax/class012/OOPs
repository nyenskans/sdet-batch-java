		 OOP is just a way of writing code and classes and objects are the basic parts of this method
	
		
		Why should we learn the OOP
		1. Because OOP simplifies the development of programs
		2. It makes it easy to manage and maintain large programs
		3. OOP is built around objects classes and many other things which can help us translate real life objects into computers
		
		
		
		
		How to write programs using OOP
		
		1. Create classes, inside the classes define properties/fields/attributes to translate how an object from real life looks like
		2. Create methods/behaviors/functions to define how that thing works in real life
		
		
		OOP is supported in many other programming languages like C#, PHP, Python, Javascript
		Other than OOP we also have different paradigms--> functional programming, structural, procedural
		// research
		
		
		How do we create a class:
		
		class Human{
		
		String name;	// attributes/properties/fields
		int age;
		double weight;
		char gender;
		
		void walk(){	//functions/behaviours/methods
		System.out.println("I can walk");
		}
		
		Methods are usually defined after attributes
		
		In java it is a convention to call attributes FIELDS and behaviors 
		
		
		public static void main(String[] args){
		
		
		Human gulbodin = new Human();
		gulbodin.name="Sameer";
		gulbodin.age=40;
		gulbodin.weight=80;
		gulbodin.gender='m'
		
		gulbodin.walk
		
		}
		}
		
		
		Rules:
		1. 	We can define fields and methods anywhere inside the class
		2. The sequence of execution only matters when we are in the method
		
		String class
		
		String is the most widely used class in java.
		// Do not name your class just String (java conflict //
		
		
		String name=new String("Katarina"); // Propper way of creating an object from a class
											// Whatever is in the parentheses is assigned to var name
		
		String name2="Katarina";
		Shorter way of creating an object because string class is heavily used in java programming
		
		All the classes in java can be treated as datatypes
