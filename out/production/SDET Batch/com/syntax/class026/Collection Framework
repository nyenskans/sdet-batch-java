Basic unit to store data is a variable:
It's easy to access the value by variable name, we don't need to worry about indexes
problems with variables:
    1) They can only store one value at a time.
    2) if we have to store more than one value using variables we have to declare
    more variables.

Arrays:
    Arrays can hold multiple values in a single variable we then use indexes to access
    those values.
Upside of Arrays:
    1)Arrays are the fastest data structure when it comes to process the data.
    2) Arrays occupy 4 times less memory than an arrayList.

problems with Arrays:
    1)They are fixed in size means once we have created an array we can't modify its size.
    2) No built-in methods in arrays like add remove findIndex etc.

ArrayList:
Note:
// ctl+c to select the complete line
//shift+end to select all the characters starting from your courser to the end of line
soutv to print the last variable
iter to loop through the elements
reiter to loop in reverse order
