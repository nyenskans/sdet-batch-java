			Actual differences between Primitive and Non primitive data types:

How primitive values work:

	int num=10;
	
	
	Area called Stack:	
	String s="USA"
	
	Area called Heap:
	A memory cell is reserved and an address is assigned for this variable
	(cell) 11 "USA"
	
	String s2="USA"
	The program will search through memory and see if there is already a value like this saved in memory
	another variable with same value--> there wont be another memory cell assigned to this var, but the same cell 11 will be assigned to it
		// This approach saves memory but it's slow
	
	
	How non primitive values work:
	
	
	 For creating
	String builder st="Katarina";
	
	no memory search is done; it goes directly to Heap and creates a memory cell
